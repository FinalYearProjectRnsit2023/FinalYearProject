        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>
          The world is moving towards a more connected paradigm, where the use
          of Internet is transferring from persons to things, resulting in the
          so-called Internet of Things (IoT) scenario which is supposed to
          embody many smart objects that can be discovered by distinctive
          addressing schemes delivering services to users by means of
          communication protocols containing billions of elements communicating
          in a heterogeneous way in terms of behavior, requirements and
          capabilities. Interactions will involve persons as well as things in
          which objects will have indirect peers on the Internet. The current
          study delineates the design and development of a smart attendance
          system for students in schools or colleges for optimum utilization of
          the teaching-learning time. We use this smart attendance system as it
          is an efficient way of managing the attendance. By using this we
          eliminate the human error and the database is updated without any
          hindrance. Smart attendance system is a modern approach to the cons
          that come with having the current attendance system which are tedious
          to manage and update. Smart attendance is a well-connected IOT device
          that has fingerprint scanner and an application that maps the
          fingerprint and updates the system within seconds.
